# Python Dictionaries: Medical Insurance Project

## Project Overview

This project involves using Python dictionaries to organize and update medical records efficiently. The goal is to create a program that manages a database of medical records for patients, including their insurance costs and other personal data.

## Objectives

- Store patient names and insurance costs using dictionaries.
- Calculate average insurance costs.
- Map patient names to their ages using list comprehension.
- Create a comprehensive medical database with detailed patient information.
- Access and manipulate data within the medical records.

## Key Features

- **Dictionary Operations**: Learn to add, update, and remove entries in a dictionary.
- **Data Calculation**: Calculate average costs using loops.
- **List Comprehension**: Use list comprehension to create dictionaries from lists.
- **Nested Dictionaries**: Store complex data structures within dictionaries.
- **Data Access**: Retrieve specific data points from nested dictionaries.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for local execution)

## Extra Practice

- Create functions to update medical records.
- Experiment with creating new dictionaries for different data sets.
